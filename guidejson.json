Although these creations are easiest to describe as holograms, they are actually the result of Pepper&rsquo;s Ghost effect. Pepper&rsquo;s Ghost is an illusion effect that makes images appear like holograms or ghostly apparitions. It is a common special effect technique used in theaters, amusement parks, concerts, and museums. The illusion is made possible with glass (or glass-like surfaces such as transparency) and light. Because of ray optics, light is reflected and refracted to produce an image that appears like a hologram.</p>"

If it can&rsquo;t, you can carefully trace the template onto a transparency with a thin permanent marker. Use a ruler to make sure the lines are precise.</p><p>Follow the directions on the download to cut out and assemble the hologram pyramid projector.</p><p>If you want to push this project further and incorporate math, you could have your students create their own templates using rulers.</p>"
